    For PART-I: 
    If you consider each furnace room as a separate graph node,
    then you get disjoint set of subgraphs and it would not be possible to
    solve it with a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. 
    
    Instead, consider each furnace room as THE SAME NODE, in other words; 
    make a single graph node and name it as the common furnace room. Let's
    call this node as S. Now, for each pipeline connecting a building to
    its own furnace room (namely the ones whose end ids are equal), replace it
    with a pipeline connecting the building to S. For instance, if p is a
    pipeline connecting building-5 to its own furnace room, now it will be
    replaced with a pipeline p' connecting building-5 to S.
    
    After reaarenging your graph as above, just apply one of the MST algorithms;
    Kruskal's or Prim's. The below implementation applies Kruskal's algorithm.
    
    FOR PART-II:
    If you see the proof of Kruskal's algorithm for instance, you could
    understand the idea below better. Here is the idea: If you add a new pipeline
    to the existing MST, then it causes a LOOP. For instance, if the new pipeline
    is between building-5 and building-17, then adding it onto the MST causes to
    occur a loop between building-5 and building-17. Then, you should trace the 
    loop and find the maximum-costly pipeline, call Pmax. If its cost is lower 
    than the cost of the new pipeline, then there is nothing extra to do, you can 
    safely return the old MST as the updated one also. However, if the new pipeline
    is less costly, then you should remove the Pmax, this preserves the tree-ness
    property. And adding new pipeline onto the tree preserves the connectedness
    of the tree. Now, you can return this updated MST.
    
    Complexity of PART-II.
    Tracing operation could be handled by BFS or DFS or any other similar O(N)
    algorithm. Also, to be more efficient, you can hold the adjenceny matrix
    as a collection of lists where each list contains the neighbor ids of a node.
    The below algorithm uses this data structure, and could handle with a graph
    of the size 2^20 nodes on the VPL platform of OdtüClass.
